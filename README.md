# Homey-Samsung-multiroom
Homey app for Samsung Multiroom

I'm the owner of a Athom Homey and earlier purchased a Samsung Multiroom system, including a Samsung Link-mate, a Samsung M7 and R6 speaker. I wanted them to connect with Homey.
My programming skills are practicly none. So i may need some help.
